<p>Changes to Terms and Conditions</p>

It is your responsibility to review these Terms and Conditions regularly.</p>

<p>Right to Edit and Remove Your Data</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, ApplyBoard reserves the right to review Your Data stored in files or programs on ApplyBoard’s servers to verify your compliance with this Agreement. ApplyBoard has the right to edit or remove any of Your Data that, in ApplyBoard’s sole discretion, ApplyBoard believes may be unlawful, obscene, abusive, or otherwise objectionable.</p>
<p>Suspension or Termination</p>
<p>ApplyBoard may impose limits on the ApplyBoard Solution or terminate or restrict your access to parts or all of the ApplyBoard Solution without liability. Where feasible, ApplyBoard will provide you with advance notice of such changes, limitations or discontinuance; however, you acknowledge that such notice may not be feasible in all circumstances, and that ApplyBoard will have no liability whatsoever for its failure to provide such notice to you.</p>
<p>ApplyBoard reserves the right to revoke your access to the ApplyBoard Solution for any abusive conduct or fraudulent use of the ApplyBoard Solution and to cease the ApplyBoard Solution temporarily or permanently, if your use of the ApplyBoard Solution constitutes, in ApplyBoard’s sole discretion, a threat to ApplyBoard or any third party’s computer systems, networks, files, materials or other data, or a breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Without limiting other remedies, ApplyBoard may limit your activity, issue a warning, temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend or terminate your account and refuse to provide ApplyBoard Solution to you if: (a) you breach this Agreement or the documents it incorporates by reference; (b) ApplyBoard is unable to verify or authenticate any information you provides; or (c) ApplyBoard believes that your actions may cause financial loss or legal liability for you, ApplyBoard Partners, other users or ApplyBoard. The above-described actions are not ApplyBoard’s exclusive remedies and ApplyBoard may take any other legal, equitable or technical action it deems appropriate in the circumstances. ApplyBoard will not have any liability to you or any third party in relation to the termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever.</p>
<p>Investigations</p>
<p>ApplyBoard reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of this Agreement.</p>
<p>You will cooperate with: (A) Governmental or Regulatory Authorities in the investigation of suspected criminal violations; (B) ApplyBoard Partners investigating academic fraud or other misdemeanours, relating to your Application or otherwise; and (C) system administrators at Internet service providers, networks or computing facilities, and other content providers, in order to enable ApplyBoard to enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
<p>10. Your Obligation to Report Errors</p>
<p>You will promptly and accurately report to ApplyBoard any actual or apparent errors, problems, nonconformities or other difficulties with the ApplyBoard Solution, along with any other information reasonably requested by ApplyBoard to aid in resolving such errors, problems, nonconformities or other difficulties, and hereby consent to the collection, processing, transmission and disclosure of such information by ApplyBoard for the purposes of ApplyBoard’s internal use to improve the ApplyBoard Solution or other ApplyBoard products or services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11. Submissions</p>
<p>Any suggestions, bug reports or other communications respecting the functionality of the ApplyBoard Solution or ApplyBoard’s website that you transmit to ApplyBoard by any means (each, a “Submission”), are considered non-confidential and may be disseminated or used by ApplyBoard or any third party without compensation or liability to you for any purpose whatsoever, whether for inclusion as part of the ApplyBoard Solution or otherwise.</p>
<p>You hereby grant ApplyBoard, its affiliates and successors a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use, copy, distribute, transmit, modify, develop, prepare derivative works of any Submission on, through or in connection with the Service, including for promoting, improving and developing the ApplyBoard Solution. This provision does not apply to Personal Information that is subject to ApplyBoard’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>12. Fees, Payment and Taxes</p>
<p>Fees</p>
<p>You will pay all applicable fees in connection with the ApplyBoard Solution, as set forth in ApplyBoard’s standard price list, as set forth on ApplyBoard’s website or as otherwise provided to you. Fees are quoted and payable in Canadian dollars for Canadian related Applications and USD U.S. related Applications.</p>
<p>ApplyBoard may require you to pay an Application processing deposit depending on the country from which you are applying, other characteristics applicable to applicants, and the related likelihood of an Application being successful due to Governmental or Regulatory Authority visa approvals. The details regarding the Application processing deposit and countries to which it will apply may be viewed on the ApplyBoard website, and may be changed by ApplyBoard from time to time. The situations where an Application processing deposit is refundable and situations where an Application processing deposit will NOT be returned to you are set out on the ApplyBoard Website. THE SITUATIONS WHERE AN APPLICATION PROCESSING DEPOSIT WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO YOU INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS, IF: (A) YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS TO PROCESS THE APPLICATION; (B) YOUR VISA APPLICATION IS REJECTED; OR (C) YOU CANCEL YOUR APPLICATION BEFORE AN ADMISSION DECISION IS RECEIVED.</p>
<p>Certain fees charged by ApplyBoard under this Agreement are set by ApplyBoard Partners or other third parties, and ApplyBoard has no control over the fee amount, but simply remits such fee directly to the applicable ApplyBoard Partner or third party, and that payment obligations are therefore non-cancellable and fees paid are non-refundable.</p>
<p>ApplyBoard reserves the right to modify such fees, upon reasonable notice, which may be performed by updating ApplyBoard’s standard price list, as set forth on ApplyBoard’s website.</p>
<p>Your use of the ApplyBoard Solution following such changes constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.</p>
<p>Fee Payment</p>
<p>Where you pay fees by means of a credit card, you authorize ApplyBoard or its third-party payment processor to automatically charge you for any and all fees incurred by you for ApplyBoard Solution. If your credit card is rejected for any reason, you will be responsible for any fees and charges associated with such rejection.</p>
<p>The foregoing will not limit ApplyBoard’s ability to exercise any rights available to it in law or equity respecting the collection of any amounts payable hereunder, and you will also be responsible for paying for all reasonable fees and costs incurred by ApplyBoard, including legal fees, in collecting any overdue amounts or enforcing any provision of this Agreement.</p>
<p>Without limiting the foregoing, ApplyBoard reserves the right not to process any Application or portion thereof prior to obtaining full payment of fees from you.</p>
<p>Interest on Late Payments</p>
<p>In addition to any other rights and remedies available to ApplyBoard, ApplyBoard will be entitled to charge interest on all outstanding amounts at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by Applicable Law, such interest commencing as of the due date for such payment.</p>
<p>Taxes</p>
<p>You are responsible for, and will pay all taxes relating to this Agreement, excluding any taxes based on the net income of ApplyBoard. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts payable by you under this Agreement are exclusive of any tax, duty, levy, or similar government charge that may be assessed by any jurisdiction, whether based on gross revenue, the delivery, possession or use of the ApplyBoard Solution, the execution of this Agreement or otherwise.</p>
<p>If you are required to withhold any taxes from payments owed under this Agreement, the amount of payment due will automatically be increased to offset such tax, so that the amount actually remitted to ApplyBoard will equal the amount due.</p>
<p>You will promptly furnish ApplyBoard with copies of all official receipts evidencing payment of taxes due under or in relation to this Agreement to the appropriate taxing authority.</p>
<p>13. Confidential Information</p>
<p>You must keep the terms of this Agreement and all information provided by ApplyBoard confidential, except to the extent required to perform the Recruitment Services.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that, during the course of the term of this Agreement, you may be exposed to Confidential Information.</p>
<p>At all times during the Term and at all times following termination of this Agreement, whether voluntary or involuntary:</p>
<p>you will maintain all Confidential Information in strict confidence, will take all necessary precautions against unauthorized disclosure of the Confidential Information, and will not directly or indirectly, disclose, allow access to, transmit or transfer any Confidential Information to a third party without the knowledge and express written consent of ApplyBoard;</p>
<p>you will not use, disclose or reproduce the Confidential Information except as reasonably required in the receipt of the Services and with the knowledge and express written consent of ApplyBoard; and</p>
<p>you will advise ApplyBoard immediately in writing of any misappropriation, disclosure, conversion or misuse by any person of any Confidential Information of which you may become aware.</p>
<p>Subject to ApplyBoard’s ability to disclose Your Data as permitted under this Agreement, ApplyBoard will use reasonable commercial endeavours to safeguard Your Data and keep it confidential, while Your Data is in ApplyBoard’s control, including implementing organisational and technical measures to protect your Personal Information. ApplyBoard may also retain and disclose Your Data to: (i) Governmental or Regulatory Authorities to the extent required by Applicable Law: (ii) its professional advisors to the extent required to: (A) enable ApplyBoard to fulfil its obligations pursuant to Applicable Law; or (B) defend or bring a claim relating to a breach of this Agreement.</p>
<p>The non­disclosure obligations under this Agreement will not apply to information which a Party can establish:</p>
<p>is, or becomes, readily available to the public other than through a breach of this Agreement;</p>
