Third-party providers are responsible for obtaining consent to provide personal information to us.<br><br>

Payment Processing and transaction tracking: ApplyBoard uses, with your consent, third party PCI certified payment service providers such as Western Union or Stripe.  Our applications are designed to directly connect our user’s security, transparently and cryptographically to the PCI certified payment processor. This ensures we maintain the privacy of your financial transactions. The payment processor provides ApplyBoard with a transaction number and status.

Sharing of Personal Information
We will not disclose, trade, rent, sell or otherwise transfer your personal information, without your consent.<br><br>

What organizations will process my personal information?<br><br>

When you view or use www.applyboard.com, or any website within ApplyBoard’s domains (applyboard.com, applyproof.com, applystudent.com) that referred you to this Privacy Policy ApplyBoard Inc. is the Controller.<br><br>

This Privacy Policy applies to the use of your personal information (also known as “personal data”, “Personally identifiable information” or PII) by ApplyBoard Inc., including its research departments.<br><br>

Schools: We share the information in your application with the schools that you are applying to (either directly or through a third party on your behalf, within Canada or abroad). Once ApplyBoard has provided your information to these schools for your application for admittance, ApplyBoard does not have any control over the use of such information by these schools and recommends that you contact them directly if you have any questions about the manner in which your personal information is treated.<br><br>

Partners: From time to time, we may partner with third parties to provide benefits to registered members of the Website. With your consent, we may provide certain personal information to third parties so that they can contact you with information about the benefits and/or we may share aggregated, non-identifiable profile and usage data with third party partners for marketing and analytics purposes.<br><br>

Business Transactions: We may transfer any information we have about you as an asset in connection with a proposed or completed merger or sale (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of ApplyBoard or as part of a corporate reorganization or other change in corporate control.<br><br>

Research and Development: With your consent ApplyBoard uses your data internally for research and development to improve our existing products and services and/or create new features to serve you better. ApplyBoard also uses non-PII data “Metadata” for this same purpose.<br><br>

With your consent, we may share your personal information with third parties involved in research and development to improve our existing products and services and/or create new features to serve you better. Such third parties may include educational institutions, academics, and others in similar fields. <br><br>

Service Providers: We may transfer (or otherwise make available) your personal information to third parties who provide services on our behalf. For example, we may use service providers such as cloud providers to send our emails, host the Website and data (including cloud providers) and operate certain of its features. Your personal information may be maintained and processed by third party service providers in the US or other jurisdictions. Our service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose personal information for their own marketing or other purposes.<br><br>

Legal Requirements: ApplyBoard and our Canadian, US and other service providers may provide your personal information in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an organization in the case of a breach of an agreement or contravention of law, or as otherwise required or permitted by applicable Canadian, US or other law. We may also disclose personal information where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims, to detect, suppress or prevent fraud, and to investigate or prevent actual or suspected loss or harm to persons or property. Where you have engaged a Recruitment Partner to submit your application to ApplyBoard, we may be required for legal, regulatory and/or compliance purposes to contact you directly to confirm certain information provided in connection with your application process.<br><br>

Data Retention
ApplyBoard will only retain your Personally Identifiable Information (PII), while it is needed to fulfill the intended purpose it was collected for or as required by law or contract which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. Typically, PII data is maintained during the time you are engaged in the institutional program you applied to, or for up to a year following our last contact with you. We may retain certain data as necessary for legitimate business purposes, such as auditing, account recovery, or if required by applicable federal, state and provincial laws, to prevent fraud or future abuse, or by contract with a partner and/or institution. All retained PII will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you request that your PII be removed from our databases and/or systems, it may not be possible to completely delete all your PII due to technological and legal constraints. However, we will take such steps as are reasonable to destroy the information or to ensure that the information is de‑identified.  Should you request additional services from ApplyBoard which are subject to this Privacy Policy, you will be authorizing the extension of the data collection and/or processing purpose as a result.<br><br>

ApplyProof document(s) will be retained for as long as they are needed for the intended purpose or as required by law or contract which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. The entity, student or institutional partner which has uploaded the document(s) for verification may request premature deletion of uploaded files. This is most likely to occur in the case where a content correction or update is required.<br><br>

Safeguards
ApplyBoard takes the safeguarding of your information very seriously. We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification and disclosure of personal information in our custody and control, including limiting access to our database to legitimate users and employing device encryption and version tracking. <br><br>

Your Rights<br>
Access <br>
Correction (Right to rectification)<br>
The right to withdraw or be forgotten<br>
The right to report or complain<br>
You may access, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal information in our custody or control at any time, subject to limited exceptions prescribed by law. Simply log into your account, go to your account profile, and make the necessary changes.<br><br>

You can also request access, corrections or updates to other personal information in our records by contacting us as set out below. We may request certain personal information for the purposes of verifying the identity of the individual seeking access to their personal information records.<br><br>

You may request your data be withdrawn (forgotten); this type of request can be performed assuming ApplyBoard is in a legal position to fulfill such a request. You must not have an active study application where financial or billing records are or may be in process should an application to a third-party service is engaged. Should ApplyBoard be able to comply to your request only the PII data you provided will be forgotten. Non-PII data, “Metadata” will be maintained regardless.<br><br>

Should you wish to lodge a concern of complaint to ApplyBoard, please contact us as set out below. We will respond to your concerns in a reasonable time, typically within 10 business days.<br><br>

Links to Other Websites: Our Website may contain links to other websites that ApplyBoard does not own or operate, including the websites of third-party partners. Also, links to our Website may be featured on third party websites on which we advertise. Except as provided herein, we will not provide any of your personal information to these third parties without your consent. We provide links to third party websites as a convenience to the user. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites. The linked websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully.

Social Media: We may offer you the opportunity to engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins, and applications. When you engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (e.g., name, username, email address, profile picture) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the website, plug-in or application. When you provide information from your social media account, we may use this information to personalize your experience on the Website and on the third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, and to provide you with other products or services you may request.<br><br>

Transferring Your Information Around the Globe
As ApplyBoard expands it service reach around the globe we may need to transfer your information to regions around the world to provide you the services and products you require. This will most likely occur when you request services from our third-party institutional providers outside of your country of origin. Such regions could include, but are not limited to, the United Kingdom (UK), the European Economic Area (EEA), Canada, USA, or Australia for example.<br><br>

Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data provided by the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documentation Act (PIPEDA).<br><br>

Online Ads/Interest-Based Advertising
We work with third parties such as ad networks and other advertising companies that use their own tracking technologies (including cookies and pixel tags) on our Website in order to provide you with tailored advertisements across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your activity on our Website and third-party websites (such as web pages you visit and your interaction with our advertising and other communications) and use this information to make predictions about your preferences, develop personalized content and deliver ads that are more relevant to you on third party websites. This information may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.<br><br>

Opting-out of Interest-Based Advertising: For more information about interest-based advertising and to understand your options, including how you can opt-out of receiving behavioural ads from third-party advertising companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada website at http://youradchoices.ca/choices.<br><br>

Please note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising by a third party, these tracking technologies may still collect data for other purposes including analytics and you will still see ads from us, but the ads will not be targeted based on behavioural information about you and may therefore be less relevant to you and your interests.<br>
To successfully opt out, you must have cookies enabled in your web browser (see your browser’s instructions for information on cookies and how to enable them). Your opt-out only applies to the web browser you use so you must opt-out of each web browser on each computer you use. Once you opt out, if you delete your browser’s saved cookies, you will need to opt-out again.<br>
Custom Audience: We may also use services provided by third-party platforms (such as social networking and other websites) to serve targeted advertisements on such platforms to you or others, and we may provide a hashed version of your email address or other information to the platform provider for such purposes. To opt out of the use of your information for such purposes, please contact us at info@applyboard.com.<br><br>
